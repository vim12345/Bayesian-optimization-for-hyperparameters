# Bayesian-optimization-for-hyperparameters

# Description:
Bayesian Optimization is a smart hyperparameter tuning technique that builds a probabilistic model of the objective function and chooses the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate based on expected improvement. Unlike grid search, itâ€™s much more efficient and sample-aware. In this project, weâ€™ll use skopt (Scikit-Optimize) to tune an SVM classifier on the Iris dataset.

# ðŸ’¡ What Makes Bayesian Optimization Powerful:
* Selects next trial using probabilistic models (like Gaussian Processes)

* Finds optimal parameters using fewer evaluations

* Efficient for expensive models or large search spaces
